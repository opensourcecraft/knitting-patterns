# Teddy Bear 


Note: the original pattern can be found [here](http://jillmc.tripod.com/teddy.html) and is also provided by SIMBA, a charity that supports parents when their baby dies.  Knitted teddies are included as part of memory boxes; if you would like to help SIMBA by knitting from this pattern, please contact them at <admin@simbacharity.org.uk> for a copy of this and other patterns.

These notes adapt the teddy bear pattern to knit in the round and in stocking stitch.  You'll need to use the magic loop or two-circular method.  You can find links to tutorials on these techniques on my [sock pattern generator](http://websockgen.herokuapp.com/) site.

#### Gauge
Not important, but I recommend you knit with a smaller needle than your chosen yarn recommends to make a firm fabric for stuffing.

#### Needles
You'll need a reasonably long circular needle (for magic loop method) or two circulars in your chosen size, plus an appropriate size crochet hook.

#### Legs
Cast on 16 stitches using a cast on that results in two rows of joined stitches, 8 on each side (as if you were starting a toe-up sock), e.g.

* crochet chain cast on

I couldn't find a tutorial for this version of the crochet cast on, so a brief description: 
Crochet chain 10 or 11 stitches.  With the smooth side of the chain facing you, knit into the top loop of each stitch to make 8 stitches.  Pull your needle through so the stitches are on the cable, and knit into the other side of the loops to make another 8 stitches.  You now have two connected rows of 8 stitches. 

Knit 16 rounds.

Repeat for second leg (or knit both at the same time as you would for socks).

#### Body
Knit across the first 8 stitches of each leg, then the second 8 stitches of each leg, to join. You now have 32 stitches in a round.
*Note: when knitting across the join between the two legs, crossing the adjoining stitches helps avoid gaps (i.e. pull the first stitch of the second leg through the last stitch of the first leg and then knit them)*

Knit 8 rounds.

#### Arms
Crochet two chains 10 or 11 stitches. 
Knit 16 stitches.  With the smooth side of one crochet chain facing you, pick up and knit 8 stitches into the top loop of each stitch. Pull your needle through so the stitches are on the cable, and pick up and knit another 8 stitches in the other side of the loops.  Knit across the remaining 16 body stitches, and repeat the crochet chain pick up for the other arm.  Place a marker for the beginning of the round.

Knit 8 rounds.

Knit 16 body stitches, then slip the first 8 arm stitches.  Turn arm inside out, and using another piece of yarn and a third needle, [3-needle bind off](http://www.purlbee.com/2013/09/03/3-needle-bind-off/) 8 stitches from the outside of the arm in.  

Pick up yarn from body stitches again and continue in the round to knit the remaining 16 body stitches (if you have a gap where you start, pick up a stitch in the gap, twist it, and knit together with the first body stitch).  Repeat 3-needle bind off for other arm.

Stuff legs, lower body and arms.

#### Neck and head
Work 19 rounds on these remaining 32 sts. Stuff, then [kitchener stitch](http://www.knitty.com/ISSUEsummer04/FEATtheresasum04.html) the top of the head closed.

#### Ears, neck, face
As per original pattern.

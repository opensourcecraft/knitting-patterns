#Snowflakes

A variety of knitted snowflake decorations

by Becky Smith (@rebkwok)

##Yarn
Small amounts of yarn – any weight, but finer yarn will produce a more delicate snowflake.  Smooth yarn such as cotton or linen is best if you plan to starch your snowflakes.  The snowflakes in the pictures use Twilleys Goldfingering metallic crochet yarn.

##Needles
DPNs or circular needles, in a size suitable for your yarn.  Snowflakes pictured were knitted on one circular 3.25mm needle.

##Other materials
Yarn needle for weaving in ends, cornflour for starching, pins for blocking.

##Gauge
Gauge is not essential for this project.  Different needle sizes will produce different effects (a larger needle will give you a more open fabric).

#Edgings

All edgings are worked by casting on and binding off multiple stitches in a variation of the picot bind off.  Use the cable cast on for all cast on edging stitches.

> **Cable cast on**  
Insert right hand needle behind the first sitch on the left hand needle, draw yarn through and slip loop onto left hand needle with a half twist. Repeat until required number of stitches have been cast on.  

After binding off stitches in the edging pattern, return the last stitch on the right hand needle to the left hand needle again before starting the next cast on group.

When starting a new cast on group, try to ensure the last group of bound off stitches does not twist.



##Edging 1

After last round of snowflake, change to contrast colour yarn:

CO5, BO2, CO5, BO5, CO2, BO5  
BO4 (from edge of snowflake)
CO4, BO2, CO2, BO2, CO2, BO4  
BO4 (from edge of snowflake) 

Repeat 6 times.

To bind off last stitch, PU and knit one in the corner of the first point worked, pass stitch over, pull yarn through loop and tighten. Break yarn and weave in end.


##Edging 2

After last round of snowflake:

CO7, BO3, CO3, BO3, CO3, BO7  
BO3 (from edge of snowflake)  
CO2, BO2, CO2, BO2, CO2, BO2  
BO3 (from edge of snowflake)  

Repeat 8 times.

To bind off last stitch, PU and knit one in the corner of the first point worked, pass stitch over, pull yarn through loop and tighten. Break yarn and weave in end.


##Edging 3

After last round of snowflake:

CO3, BO4, CO6, BO7, CO3, BO4  
BO3 (from edge of snowflake)  
CO3, BO4, CO9, BO10, CO3, BO4  
BO3 (from edge of snowflake)

Repeat 4 times.

To bind off last stitch, PU and knit one in the corner of the first point worked, pass stitch over, pull yarn through loop and tighten. Break yarn and weave in end.




##Edging 4

After last round of snowflake:

CO3, BO3, CO5, BO5, CO3, BO3  
BO6 (from edge of snowflake)  

Repeat 8 times.

To bind off last stitch, PU and knit one in the corner of the first point worked, pass stitch over, pull yarn through loop and tighten. Break yarn and weave in end.



#Finishing

Snowflakes will look like a crumpled curly mess before blocking!  To make a snowflake that will hang as a decoration and hold its shape, it will need to be starched as well as blocked.

###Cornflour starch
Mix ½ cup cornflour with 1 cup cold water until dissolved.
Put 2 cups water in a small pan and bring to the boil.
Add the cornflour solution to the boiling water gradually, and stir until thickened.  The mixture should be very thick and jelly-like, but add a little more cold water if too thick.

Pour cornflour starch mixture into a bowl and submerge snowflakes. When completely saturated, remove to a clean tea towel and press out excess mixture.  Place snowflake on greaseproof paper on top of cork or a thick towel on the floor to block.  Stretch into shape, pulling the lace out as much as possible and pin in place.  Be sure to pin out every point of the edging.   You can draw a circle on the greaseproof paper to give you a guideline for the shape you want to block to.

When dry, remove all pins and peel the now rigid snowflake off the greaseproof paper.

###Hanging Loop
To make a loop to hang up your snowflakes, use a small crochet hook to make a tight crochet chain of the desired length and attached to the edging to form a loop.

##Yarn
Small amounts of:  
* DK yarn in red
* DK faux fur/eyelash yarn in white 
(Hats in the picture use Sirdar Snuggly DK in red and Sirdar Funky Fur in white)

##Needles
* DPNs or circular needles, 2.5 - 3mm (gauge is not essential, but a smaller needle gives a denser fabric which is better for holding shape 
* small crochet hook (2-3mm)

##Other materials
* Yarn needle for weaving in ends

##Gauge
Use a smaller needle size than usually recommended for your yarn in order to produce a dense knitted fabric. Gauge is not essential for this project.

Purl 5, without turning, pass first 4 stitches over 5th stitch

##Hanging Loop

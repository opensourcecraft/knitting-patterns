## Yarn 
Small amounts of:

* 4ply or sock yarn in brown
* 4ply or sock yarn in cream or white
* Laceweight yarn, crochet cotton or embroidery thread in green
* 4ply or DK yarn in red

## Needles
* DPNs or circular needles, 2 to 3mm (gauge is not essential, but a smaller needle gives a denser fabric which is better for stuffing
* Small crochet hook (2-3mm)

## Other materials
* Material for stuffing (scrap yarn, fibre filling etc)
* Yarn needle for weaving in ends

## Gauge
Use a smaller needle size than usually recommended for your yarn in order to produce a dense knitted fabric. Gauge is not essential for this project.

# Directions

Stuff until fairly firm.

Round 23: (K1, k2tog) 6 times [12 sts]  
Round 24: knit  
Round 25: (k2tog) 6 times [6 sts]  

Break yarn, thread onto yarn needle, thread through remaining 6 stitches, pull tight and tie off.  Run needle down centre of pudding and out the other side. Cut yarn close so the end is hidden inside.  

##Holly Leaves

###First leaf:
With green yarn, CO3.
Rows 1-3: K  
Row 4: k1, m1, k1, m1, k1 [5 st]  
Row 5: k1, p3, k1  
Row 6: k2, m1, k1, m1, k2 [7 st]  
Row 7: Cast off 2, p to last stitch K1 [5st]  
Row 8: Cast off 2, m1, k1, m1, k1 [5st]  
Row 9: k1, p3, k1  
Row 10: k2, m1, k1, m1, k2 [7 st]  
Row 11: Cast off 2, p to last stitch K1 [5st]  
Row 12: Cast off 2, k to end [3 st]  
Row 13: p3tog  

Break yarn, draw end through last stitch on needle, pull tight and weave in end.

###Second leaf:
With RS of first leaf facing you, and leaving a yarn tail of around 30cm, pick up and knit 3 sts along cast on edge.  Repeat as for first leaf.

You now have 2 holly leaves joined together along a central seam. Use the yarn end from your cast on to stitch the centre of the leaves to the top of the pudding.

###Holly Berries
With red yarn, CO1.

Row 1: k1, p1, k1 in the single CO stitch. Turn. [3 sts]  
Row 2: sl1, p2  
Row 3: sl1, k2tog, psso [1st]  

Repeat once more for 2 berries or twice more for 3 berries.  Break yarn, leaving a 30 cm tail and thread through last stitch to bind off.  You now have 2 or 3 little bobbles joined together. Thread the yarn end onto a needle and join the cast on and bind off edges together.  Stitch berries to centre of holly leaves, stitching through pudding as well to secure.

(Alternatively, stitch red beads on for berries.)

##Hanging Loop
To make a loop to hang up your pudding, use a small crochet hook to make a tight crochet chain of the desired length and attach to the pudding close to the holly leaves.

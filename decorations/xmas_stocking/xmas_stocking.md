##Yarn
Small amounts of 4ply or sock yarn in any colours

##Needles
DPNs or circular needles, 2 to 3mm (gauge is not essential, but a smaller needle gives a denser fabric which is better for holding shape when hung up; small crochet hook (2-3mm)

##Other materials
Yarn needle for weaving in ends

##Gauge
Use a smaller needle size than usually recommended for your yarn in order to produce a dense knitted fabric. Gauge is not essential for this project.

#Toe

Divide between DPNs and place marker after 6 stitches, or put 6 on each of 2 circulars, or each loop if using one circular magic loop method.

Round 1: (k1, m1, knit to 1 stitch before marker (or end of needle), m1, k1) twice [16 sts]  
Round 2: knit   
Round 3: (k1, m1, knit to 1 stitch before marker (or end of needle), m1, k1) twice [20 sts]

If knitting toe in contrast colour, change to main sock colour now.

#Foot
Knit until foot measures 2.5 cm after end of toe (main colour section if knitting heel and toe in contrast colour).

#Heel
If knitting heel toe in contrast colour, change back to contract colour now.

The heel is knit back and forth on the first 14 stitches only.  If using DPNs, put the second 14 stitches on a holder or waste yarn.

#Leg
If using contract colour to knit heel, pick up main colour again now.

Row 17: Sl1 purlwise, knit around

Continue knitting in st st until leg measures 5cm from end of heel (main colour section if knitting heel and toe in contrast colour).

#Cuff
If using contract colour to knit cuff, change to contrast colour now.
Knit garter stitch (k 1 round, p 1 round) for 1 cm.  Cast off, preferably using Elizabeth Zimmermanâ€™s sewn bind off.  Leave enough yarn to have about 30 cm left after finishing the cast off.

#Hanging Loop
To make a loop to hang up your stocking, use a small crochet hook. Weave yarn through stitches until it is at the back of the leg, then use remaining yarn tail to make a tight crochet chain of the desired length and stitch back into the top of the stocking to form a loop.

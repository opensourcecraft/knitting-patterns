*garment is worked with extra length in body so actual leg length of garment is shorter than body measurements

# LEGS (Make 2)

### Folded hem
Using a provisional cast on, and CC, cast on 58 (60, 62, 66, 68).
Starting with a knit row, work 2 rows in CC and 3 rows in MC.
K 1 row (on WS) to make turning ridge for hem.
Work 5 rows in st st in stripe pattern.  Maintain stripe pattern throughout.

Next row (WS): knit in folded hem as follows:
Unzip provisional CO and put CO stitches on another needle or dpn.  Fold hem under, hold needle with Co stitches and live stitches together.  Purl one stitch from each needle together to join hem.

Continue in st st until leg measures 4¼” (5¼”, 6¼”, 7¼”, 8¼”), ending with a purl row.  On last round, plach marker (SM) after 29 (30, 31, 33, 34) stitches to mark centre (this will be the side seam).

### Alternative sewn hem
Use a normal CO, omit the row that knits in the folded hem, and sew the hem down at the end.

Alternatively, use a provisional CO and omit the hem rows altogether (start immediately on RS st st).  When the garment is finished up to the point of finishing, try it on child to determine exact leg length required.  Unzip provisional CO and work in st st to desired length, work 1 row P on right side (or K on WS) to make turning ridge, then work an additional 5 rows st st.  Cast off, fold hem under and sew in place.

# BODY

Using circular needle, slip stitches of one leg to about 15 stitches after SM.  Join yarn, PM (start of round marker - RM), knit to end of first leg, provisional cast on 3 (3, 4, 4, 4) stitches for crotch, knit across second leg, provisional CO 3 (3, 4, 4, 4) stitches for crotch join in round to beginning of first leg and knit to RM (122 (126, 132, 140, 144) stitches).

Knit straight until work measures 4½” (5½”, 6½”, 7½”, 8½”) from crotch.  

>Use the [jogless join](http://www.craftsy.com/blog/2013/08/knitting-jogless-stripes-in-the-round/) technique when changing colour. RM will move one stitch to the left each time but all colour changes should stay on the first half of the work (back). 

\*Next round: [Knit to 5 before SM, K2tog, K to 3 after SM, SPK] twice, K to end of round
Knit 6 (6, 7, 8, 8) rounds\* [(118 (122, 128, 136, 140) stitches]

Repeat rounds between * 2 more times [(110 (114, 120, 128, 132) stitches)]

Next round: [Knit to 5 before SM, K2tog, K to 3 after SM, SPK] twice, K to end of round [(106 (110, 116, 124, 128) stitches)]
Knit 3 ( 6, 5, 5, 6] rounds

If you are now at the start of a 1st or 3rd row of stripe, K1 extra row here.

## DIVIDE AT ARMHOLES

# FINISHING

With circular or 3 dpns and MC, and right side front facing: PU and knit 3 stitches for every 4 rows starting at bottom edge of one inside leg.  Knit across 4 stitches from provisional cast on at crotch.  PU and knit 1 stitch for every row from crotch to bottom edge of second inside leg.

Work 3 stitch [applied i-cord](http://www.purlbee.com/2008/01/23/attached-i-cord-tutorial/) around inside legs.  Repeat for inside legs on back piece.

Starting at one armpit, with RS facing, and MC, PU and knit all around straps, neck and back neck, picking up one stitch for every row up sides and knitting across stitches on safety pins and holders when you come to them.  Where the edge is doubled sided, PU through the visible stitches – this will be one stitch for every 2 rows worked.  

Provisional CO 3 stitches and work applied i-cord all around.  Graft the final live stitches to the provisional CO.

**Note:** To use buttons instead of poppers: work buttonholes into the applied i-cord by casting off 2 or 3 stitches at appropriate points (depending on size of buttons) and working non-applied i-cord for the corresponding stitches.  Sew buttons as fasteners for the straps and/or inside leg.

>Unless you have a lot of circular or dpns, you will need to work the pick up and applied i-cord for the arms and neck edging at the same time.  Pick up on circular needle to the top edge of one strap, pick up on a dpn across the top of the strap.  Now start the applied i-cord at the beginning of the picked up stitches and work until the circular needle is free, then use the circular needle to pick up the next set of stitches before continuing with the applied i-cord.

Sew in ends and block to given measurements.
Sew or rivet popper fasteners to shoulder straps and to inside legs.
